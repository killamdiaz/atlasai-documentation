Welcome to the **Atlas API reference**.

# Atlas API

Atlas is the backend that powers AtlasAI’s core capabilities—agent execution, workflows, memory, ingestion, connectors, and system administration—through a single HTTP API.

Use this page to understand how to authenticate, what conventions we follow, and how to navigate the reference.

## Base URL

Most requests share the same path structure — you only need to change the **base URL** depending on where Atlas is running.

- **Atlas Cloud (default):** `https://api.atlasengine.ai`
- **Self‑hosted / On‑prem:** `https://<your-atlas-host>` (example: `https://atlas-api.company.internal`)
- **Local development:** `http://localhost:<port>` (example: `http://localhost:8080`)

### Recommended setup

Define a single environment variable and reuse it across every request:

```bash
export ATLAS_API_URL="https://api.atlasengine.ai"

# Self-hosted / on-prem example:
# export ATLAS_API_URL="https://atlas-api.company.internal"

# Local dev example:
# export ATLAS_API_URL="http://localhost:8080"
```

> **Tip:** The **paths stay the same** across environments — only the host/port changes.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require a **Bearer token**.

```bash
curl -X GET "$ATLAS_API_URL/healthz" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>"
```

<Note>
Some endpoints (like certain health checks) may be public, but you should assume authentication is required unless the endpoint explicitly says otherwise.
</Note>

---

## Request format

### JSON by default

Most endpoints accept and return JSON.

Use:

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Accept: application/json`

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST "$ATLAS_API_URL/<endpoint>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"example": true}'
```

### IDs

Many resources use UUID-style identifiers (e.g., `agentId`, `workflowId`, `conversationId`). Treat them as opaque strings.

---

## Responses & error handling

### Common success codes

- `200 OK` — successful read/update
- `201 Created` — resource created (when applicable)
- `204 No Content` — successful request with no response body (when applicable)

### Common error codes

- `400 Bad Request` — malformed request
- `401 Unauthorized` — missing/invalid token
- `403 Forbidden` — token is valid but lacks access
- `404 Not Found` — resource doesn’t exist
- `409 Conflict` — state conflict / duplicate
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — validation errors
- `5xx` — server-side failure

<Tip>
When debugging, capture **(1)** the HTTP status code, **(2)** the response body, and **(3)** the request id / correlation id if your client captures it. Validation errors are usually explained in the response body.
</Tip>

## Streaming endpoints

Some endpoints may stream responses (for example, long-running chat/agent runs or event streams). These commonly use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** (`text/event-stream`).

If you’re calling a streaming endpoint:

- Don’t try to parse the response as a single JSON object.
- Use an SSE-capable client (browser `EventSource`, or a Node/Python streaming client).

---

## Navigating the API reference

Endpoints are organized by **tags** (for example: Auth, Workflows, Agents, Memory, Ingestion, Connectors, System). Use the left sidebar to browse by area.

## Quick sanity check

To verify connectivity:

```bash
curl -sS "$ATLAS_API_URL/healthz"
```

## Next steps

- Start with the section that matches your integration:
  - **Workflows**: build/run workflows
  - **Agents**: run tool agents / sessions
  - **Memory**: store/query context
  - **Ingestion**: jobs, indexing, and search
  - **Connectors**: OAuth + integrations

If you tell me which 2–3 areas you’re documenting first (e.g., Workflows + Memory + Ingestion), I can tailor this intro with a recommended “happy path” flow and example calls.
